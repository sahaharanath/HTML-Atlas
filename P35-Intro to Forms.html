<body>
<!-- Simple form with the action attribute -->
<form action="/action">
    <!-- Input field (additional attributes can be added) -->
    <input>
    <!-- Add more form elements as needed (e.g., textareas, checkboxes, etc.) -->

    <!-- Note: The absence of a submit button may be intentional, or it could be added based on the form's purpose. -->
</form>

<!-- Additional Information:
     - The 'action' attribute specifies the URL to which the form data will be sent upon submission.
     - This example lacks a submit button; one can be added using the <button> or <input type="submit"> element.
     - Various input types and attributes can be used based on the type of data the form is collecting.
